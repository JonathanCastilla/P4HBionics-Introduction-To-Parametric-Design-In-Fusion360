# P4HBionics: Introduction to Parametric Design in Fusion 360


Welcome to my work I have done for **P4HBionics course: Introduction to Parametric Design in Fusion 360**! This project showcases my solutions and exercises from the *P4HBionics Academy* course, focusing on parametric design using Autodesk Fusion 360. The course emphasizes creating adaptable and reusable 3D models, particularly in the context of biomechanical prosthetics.
